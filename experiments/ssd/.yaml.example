# Created on YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss

network:  # Specifications by which the detection and recognition training should follow
  start_iter:  # (integer) - Denoting the start of iterations. Can be overridden when `--resume` flag is present
  end_iter: # (integer) - End of iterations, calculated by ([num_data * max_usage / max_data] / batch_size) * epochs
  decay_lr: # Specification of when and by what value to decay the learning rate
    iterations: # (list[integer]) - Iterations of which to decay the learning rate
      - 40000
      - 50000
    gamma: # (float) - By what should the learning rate be decayed
  pretrained: # (boolean|string) - Whether to load/not load the VGG-16 base model (if boolean), or load a given path to `.pth` file if the value of this field is string
  cuda: # (boolean) - Force to use CUDA device or not. If `False`, CPU is used; if `True`, GPU with CUDA is used; if `~`, automatic CUDA selection will occur

optimizer:
  lr: # (float) - Learning rate to be used by the optimizer. Also serves as initial learning rate to be used in learning rate decay
  momentum: # (float) - Momentum of SGD optimizer, which is used as the default optimizer in this model's implementation
  weight_decay: # (float) - Weight decay of SGD optimizer

dataset:
  source: # (string) - Source of individual (cropped) image in the dataset, where the images are stored with respect to each's class
  batch_size: # (integer) - Size of mini-batch to be received by the model before backpropagating error
  to_tensor: # (boolean) - Whether to directly transform the transformed image to tensor or not
  combined:
    max_data: # (integer) - How many individual image can be combined to a single combined image
    max_usage: # (integer) - Maximum individual image usage in constructing combined images
    min_resize: # (integer) - Minimum resize, either in width and/or height, for each individual image
    max_resize: # (integer) - Maximum resize, either in width and/or height, for each individual image

savefile:  # (string) - Where to save the weights of training a model with this specification; weight saving will occur per iteration
